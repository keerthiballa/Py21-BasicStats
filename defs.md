## Statistics are a key tool of a Data Engineer. 
## So what are the definitions of these measures of data??

### Count?
A frequency count is a measure of the number of times that an event occurs.


### Range of the dataset?
The range of a set of data is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the set.


### Mean?
The arithmetic mean, or simply the mean or the average, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.


### Variance?
Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its population mean or sample mean. Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.


### Median?
Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers.


### Mode?
The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values

### Standard Deviation?
The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

### Standard Error of the Mean?
The standard error of a statistic is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution or an estimate of that standard deviation. If the statistic is the sample mean, it is called the standard error of the mean.

## What do these measures tell you about the dataset if:

### the measure is a large number?
These measures are a good representation of the population/ observations as large dataset implies more number of observations 
### the measure is a very small?
Very less dataset implies few observations. So the measures may not be a good representation of the population/observations.
